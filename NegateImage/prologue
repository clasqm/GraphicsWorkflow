//*****Global Variables****
//*************************
 
## Technically, yab does not require you to declare global variables,
##It just is a really, really good idea to do it anyway.
//This template uses more global variables than it really needs
//but it is not something that is going to run for hours
//slobbering up memory

// set DEBUG = 1 to print out all messages on the console
DEBUG = 0
//IMPORTANT
//change this to DEBUG = 0 when you are ready to bind the program for distribution
//Without this change, piping will not work
